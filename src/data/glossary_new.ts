Many traditions understood the Sun as relational vitality rather than personal ego.",
      "design_logic": "In the Fluid Astrology interface the Sun defines how vitality radiates into the relational space of the spiral, shaping the felt atmosphere rather than defining identity as fixed. It informs luminous shaders, warm palettes, and centered but non-hierarchical emphasis.",
      "queer_theory_links": "Connected to the idea of identity as performed illumination (Butler) rather than an essential core. Aligns with queer selfhood as process, becoming, and expressive presence.",

      "design_logic": "Represents inner tides and memory in the UI, influencing slower animations, tides, pulsing light patterns, and atmospheric textures associated with the emotional undercurrent of each layer.",
